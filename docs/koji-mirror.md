## Subscriptions

* To obtain RHEL bits, the machine needs to be subscribed to the Red Hat Portal
* The subscription is done using the `theforeman` account, that has "Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Open Source Infrastructure" subscriptions

## Mirroring

* `/etc/reposync.conf` is a DNF configuration file with the repositories we want to sync.
  It uses the entitlement cert from `/etc/pki/entitlement/` to authenticate against the CDN.
  We cannot use the normal `/etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo` as we want to sync RHEL8 and RHEL9, while `subscription-manager` only provisions the *matching* (RHEL8) repositories in that file.
* `/etc/cron.weekly/reposync` calls `dnf reposync` with the above configuration file and the list of the repositories, thus syncing the content.
* TBD: flattening


## Serving

There is an Apache httpd running on the machine, serving `/srv/mirror`.
It's only reachable from inside our AWS VPC due to the applied Security Group and the Apache IP restrictions.
