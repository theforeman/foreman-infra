# Foreman Infrastructure

The Foreman project runs a number of different servers for testing, packaging, and continuous integration.
This infrastructure is maintained by the Infrastructure Special Interest Group (SIG).

Communication happens using [Discourse](https://community.theforeman.org/c/development/infra/24). It meets regularly and [posts meeting notes](https://community.theforeman.org/search?q=infrastructure%20sig%20meeting%20notes%20%23development%3Ainfra%20in%3Atitle%20order%3Alatest).

Issues are [tracked using GitHub](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-infra/issues) and also visible [on a board](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-infra/projects/1).
