# @summary A shared secret storage
#
# The shared secret storage creates a group where all users have access
# to a shared directory for use with gopass. It is then expected that
# there are several git repositories within that directory. Each
# repository is created using:
# `git init --bare --shared=group therepo.git`
#
# @param group The group every user should be part of
# @param path The location to store the git repositories
# @param users The users who should be part of the group
#
# @see https://www.gopass.pw/
