<h3>Stable Foreman releases</h3>

<p>Releases are available under <code>/releases/VERSION/DIST/ARCH</code>, e.g.</p>

<ul>
  <li>/releases/1.15/el7/x86_64</li>
  <li>/releases/1.15/f24/x86_64</li>
</ul>

<p>foreman-release RPMs containing an appropriate .repo file are available with fixed URLs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/latest/el7/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm">http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/latest/el7/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/latest/f24/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm">http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/latest/f24/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Release packages <a href="https://theforeman.org/security.html#GPGkeys">are signed with a new key for each major release</a>.  The public key is available in the RPM-GPG-KEY-foreman file within each version directory or the foreman-release RPMs.</p>

<p>A symlink is available at <code>/releases/latest</code> which always points to the latest stable release.  Please be careful when using this, as release upgrades often require some manual intervention (see release notes).</p>

<h3>Nightly builds and release candidates</h3>

<p>Nightly builds of Foreman are available under <code>/nightly/DIST/ARCH</code> and are refreshed a few times a day, but are not GPG signed.</p>

<p>Release candidates are in the versioned directories under <code>/releases</code>.  These are GPG-signed like stable packages.</p>

<h3>Plugins</h3>

<p>A number of Foreman plugins are available in the plugin repos, see <a href="https://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Plugins">Plugins</a> and <a href="https://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/List_of_Plugins">List of Plugins</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Plugin repos are structured by the Foreman version that they're compatible with in the format <code>/plugins/VERSION/DIST/ARCH</code>, e.g.</p>

<ul>
  <li>/plugins/1.15/el7/x86_64</li>
  <li>/plugins/nightly/f24/x86_64</li>
</ul>

<p>Plugin repos are not GPG signed.</p>
