# Semi-crude script to run daily for doing initial parsing of apache logs to
# remove lines we definitely don't want. It gets:
#
# * only successful requests (code == 200)
# * only GET requrests
# * only actual packages (strings ending in .rpm or .deb)
# * strips out "source", "tfm" and "rubygem" from the rpms to distinguish
#   foreman packages from dependencies
#
# This reduces the apache logs by a factor of about 20, which can then be
# downloaded for further intensive processing (by date, version, user-agent,
# etc) - date processing is particularly cpu instensive, so it's best kept off
# the webserver.
#
# This script is intended to run daily on the latest logfile, however, since it
# is possible that a logrotation has happened overnight, the last *two* files
# are parsed. Files are datestamped with a one-week cleanup.
