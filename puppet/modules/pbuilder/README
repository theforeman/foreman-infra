=== Parameters

The pbuilder type takes the following arguments :
 - ensure: whether the pbuilder should be present
     Possible values: "present", "absent"
     Defaults to "present"
 - release: the Debian/Ubuntu release to be used
     (sarge/etch/lenny/dapper/feisty/gusty/etc.)
     Defaults to $lsbdistcodename
 - arch: the architecture of the pbuilder (i386, amd64, etc.)
     Defaults to $architecture
 - methodurl: the URL used to grab the packages from 
     (e.g. http://ftp.debian.org/debian)
     Defaults to "" (not functional, only useful for "ensure => absent")
 - site: a hash used to find the right apt.config directory 
     (in puppet://${server}/apt/${release}/${arch}/${site})
     Defaults to "" (not functional, only useful for "ensure => absent")
 - debbuildopts: the options to send to debuild (see `man dpkg-buildpackage`)
     Defaults to "-b"
 - bindmounts: a list of space-separated directories to bind-mount in the chroot
     Defaults to ""
 - bindir: where to put the pbuilder script
     Defaults to "/usr/local/bin"
 - chrootdir: where to put the basetgz tarball
     Defaults to "/var/chroot/pbuilder"
 - confdir: where to store the configuration for the script
     Defaults to "/etc/pbuilder"
 - cachedir: where to create the aptcache, build and result directories
     Defaults to "/var/cache/pbuilder"


This module assumes the following directories:

Configuration:
 - ${confdir}/$name : root for the pbuilder conf
 - ${confdir}/$name/pbuilderrc : configuration file for the pbuilder
 - ${confdir}/$name/apt.config : apt config file (including sources.list) for the pbuilder
 - ${confdir}/$name/hooks : hooks for the pbuilder

Cache:
 - ${cachedir}/$name : root for the pbuilder cache
 - ${cachedir}/$name/aptcache : aptcache for the pbuilder
 - ${cachedir}/$name/build : build directory for the pbuilder
 - ${cachedir}/$name/result : result packages for the pbuilder

Chroot:
 - ${chrootdir}/base_$name.tgz : compressed chroot for the pbuilder



=== Examples


==== Set a pbuilder using the release and architecture of the host

pbuilder { "feisty":
   methodurl => "http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu",
}


==== Destroy an old existing pbuilder

pbuilder { "dapper":
   ensure => absent
}


==== Set an am64 pbuilder for the etch release, including sources in the .changes

pbuilder { "etch-amd64":
   release      => etch,
   methodurl    => "http://ftp.debian.org/debian",
   debbuildopts => "-sa"
}



=== Important note

You have to provide a valid apt.config directory for your pbuilder.
You can use the apt class for that, and notify the private pbuilder_update Exec.
