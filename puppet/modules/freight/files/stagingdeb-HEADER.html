<h1>The Debian Foreman staging repo</h1>

<p>This repo is for building and testing scratch packages before pushing them to the real repos</p>

<p>Every user will have the packages pushed to their own component, based on the github repository used.<br/>
So if you specified 'ares' as the github repo, and 'buster' as the distro, your package is at:</p>

<pre>deb http://stagingdeb.theforeman.org/ buster ares-nightly</pre>

<p>Plugins are in a similar per-user component:</p>

<pre>deb http://stagingdeb.theforeman.org/ plugins ares</pre>

<p>This repo is also available over rsync at <code>rsync://rsync.theforeman.org/stagingdeb</code>.</p>

<p>Enjoy</p>
